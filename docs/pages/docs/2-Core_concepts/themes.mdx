# Themes

Getting started with Gatsby Themes and Theme UI.

## About themes

Gatsby has the ability to shadow code. It's awesome!  To do this, you can overwrite any module/package file's that live
inside the `src/` directory.

## Overriding

To override a specific file, copy the file you wish to change to `src/my-module/file.js` (obviously changing the module
and filename to match the override) and then restart your server.
