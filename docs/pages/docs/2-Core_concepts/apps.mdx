# Applications

Applications provide core features and integrations

## What is an application?

For each section of the stack, known as "applications," there are individual are top-level standalone components that may
include packages.

As a general rule of thumb, applications should contain a `packages` directory that contains application specific packages and a
`starters` directory that provides ready to be provision instances of that application.

Currently, the applications are as follows:

## Backend

This application contains the content management and data storage functionality.  It's built using a headless instance of Drupal.

## Frontend

This application contains all the presentation and drag and drop editing logic.  It's build using TinaCMS and Gatsby.
