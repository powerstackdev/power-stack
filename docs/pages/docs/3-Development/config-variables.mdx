# Configuration Variables

Where to find the two types of configuration variables and how they interact with Power Stack.

## Docksal config files

Docksal comes with two configuration files `docksal.env` and `docksal-local.env`.

### The base `docksal.env`

This file ships with all instances of Power Stack.

```bash
#  Where the backend docroot is located.  Docksal defaults to "docroot"
DOCROOT=web

# MySQL settings.
DB_IMAGE='docksal/mysql:5.7-1.4'
# MySQL will be exposed on a random port. By default.  This sets it to 3306
MYSQL_PORT_MAPPING='0:3306'

# Disable debugging by default
XDEBUG_ENABLED=0

# Define which starters to use
BACKEND_STARTER="development"
FRONTEND_STARTER="development"
```

### Overriding with `docksal-local.env`

Any Docksal environment variables can be overridden by including theme in the `docksal-local.env` file.

## Power Stack config files
