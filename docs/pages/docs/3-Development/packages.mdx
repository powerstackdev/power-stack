# Packages

## About packages

Power Stack is using a monorepo to create and manage packages.

## Packages

One of the key goals for our packages is to be centrally managed but then distributed to their respective open-source
project (e.g. a Drupal module or Gatsby Theme/Plugin).

## Creating a new package

The naming convention for the package repos is `{service}_{package}`.
